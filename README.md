# PokemonUI
GUI that runs pokemon scripts that I made.
It dynamically pulls them down from their own repos so if I change the scripts, I don't have to recompile the EXE file to update the changes.

# WARNING
Windows Security will flag this as a trojan as it runs scripts that control your keyboard and mouse input to play the game for you
