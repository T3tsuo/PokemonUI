# WARNING
Windows Security will flag this as a trojan as it runs scripts that control your keyboard and mouse input to play the game for you.


# Game Configuration:
* Make battle log as minimized as possible, make the chat transparency 100 and lock the chat.
* Set window size: 1280x720 in Settings.
* Turn off, 'Show Overworld in Battle' and 'Show Battle Background' in Settings/Video.
* Controls are default
* Extract the 'black_battle_options.zip' and add it as a custom theme (search up how to add custom themes to the game).

# Path Correction/Item Farming Setup:
* Sometimes the script will overshoot/undershoot the path the player takes. Setting this up will help the script 
correct any path it misses (currently working for Ditto Farm, Amulet Farming and Everstone Farming).
* For Item finding, it will make sure to read the latest battle log only and not read older battle logs by knowing where your game is on your screen.

## Setup:
* Press the gear icon in the app, press Add under Game Path and paste the directory path (only needs to be ran once).

## Delete:
* To delete, just press the gear icon in the app, and press Remove under Game Path.


# Gmail Notification:
## This is optional
Emails you when game encounters a shiny (the script will end itself when it encounters one automatically) 
or when the script has finished running.

## Setup:
* Generate google app password for account
* Press the gear icon in the app, press Add under Gmail Notify and input email address and correlated app password (only needs to be ran once)
