# PokemonUI
GUI that runs 3 pokemon scripts that I made.
It dynamically pulls them down from their own repos so if I change the scripts, I don't have to recompile the EXE file to update the changes.

## Scripts:
Look at the scripts repos README file to see how to configure your team or game.

## Game Configuration:
* Make battle log as minimized as possible and lock the chat.
* Set window size: 1280x720 in Settings
